# Forth6502

THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS.  Currently, the 65816 version will _not_
work on the Foenix F256K.  It will run a loop showing useless debug
about the key scans.

Filesystem support is functional (at least for reading files) on the
F256K 6502 version.

# Building

You need https://github.com/srichy/rfc to build this, as well as
64tass.  rfc should be checked out in a directory at the same level as
this repository.

All The Things need to be cleaned up and better organized.  TODO.

## Design Notes: TBD

I removed the old ones.  They were hugely out-of-date.

# Credits and References

I can't recommend enough
[Brad Rodriguez'](http://www.bradrodriguez.com/papers/) writings on Forth
internals.

Also, I have to chase down where I got the number parsing code.  If
you recognize it, let me know and I'll add the credit or remove it and
rewrite it or whatever.

# One of Gadget's Ideas

"Over travel &c this morning, I sketched out a 65c02 specific set of
 core Forth words.  DTC, RS in zp, PS on the hardware stack, TOS in
 Y:A, base IP in zp w/ relative IP in X.  I sketched out push, pop,
 drop, +, @, !, ENTER, LEAVE, and, of course, NEXT, which is in-lined."

Also, "8-bit jump offsets".
